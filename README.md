# API Project

In this project I was focused on constructing my own back end. The sections of the back end which I focused on was constructing a database and constructing my APIs from scratch.

## Database

My database was built using Mongoose. The way I constructed it is by creating models in the server/db/model folder. In the server/db/seed.js file is where I seeded my database.

## APIs

The way I build out my API's was in the server/api/index.js folder where I build out my app server. After building the app server, I had to modularize my routes for each model, all of this progress was stored in the server/api/routes folder.
